Project
=======
This repository will hold the files written and used to complete the BS32010 Applied Bioinformatics Practical Project.
For ease of access the data files and scripts used have been split into the 3 areas of the project:
* The folder DESeq2 hold the script used to analyse the experiment results with the DESeq2 package.
* The folder limma hold the files used and created when running limma analysis on the microarray data.
* The folder Comparative Genomics holds the scripts and data used to undertake phylogenetic and comparative genomic analysis on the selected genes.

- Please note that each individual folder has a seperate readme file to describe the content of each of the files.

** This Repository also holds the file history_commands.txt which is the command history from the Xming software, that was implemented throughout the course of this project.
** The report and presentation used to complete this project have also been included in this repository.
